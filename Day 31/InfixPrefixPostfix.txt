Definition of Infix, Postfix, and Prefix
Infix: The typical mathematical form of expression that we  generally use  is known as infix notation. In infix form, an operator is written in between two operands.

For example: 
An expression in the form of A * ( B + C ) / D is in infix form. This expression can be simply decoded as: Add B and C, then multiply the result by A, and then divide it by D for the final answer.”

Prefix: In prefix expression, an operator is written before its operands. This notation is also known as “Polish notation”.

For example, The above expression can be written in the prefix form as / * A + B C D. This type of expression cannot be simply decoded as infix expressions.

Postfix: In postfix expression, an operator is written after its operands. This notation is also known as “Reverse Polish notation”.

For example, The above expression can be written in the postfix form as A B C + * D /. This type of expression cannot be simply decoded as infix expressions.

=>Prefix Notations are needed whe we require operators before the operands while postfix notations are needed after the operands.
=>Prefix notations and Postfix notations can be evaluated faster than the infix notation.
=>Prefix and Postfix notations are easier to parse for a machine.
=>With prefix and postfix notation there is never any question like operator precedence.
=>There is no issue of left-right associativity.
