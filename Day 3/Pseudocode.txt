Pseudo code is a term often used in programming and algorithm.Different people use different programming languages, and that often becomes a problem.Developers who don't  know that language it would be hard to undestand it.To solve this problem we can use pseudocode.
"A special language that stands somewhere in between human language and code".
Pseudo code as the name suggests,is a false code  or a representation of codewhich can be understood by a persons who have basic knowledge on programming language.It mainly writes  the "logical core",which is essence of any program.
It will omit the the variable declarations,importing libraries etc..
	It is like blue print for the program.It better describes the idea of an algorithm without complications.It simply describes it in human language.
It improves the readability.
The main goal of a pseudo code is to explain what exactly each line of a program should do, hence making the code construction phase easier for the programmer.
Don't make pseudocode too generalized.
Don't make the code to abstract.

Tips for how to write a Pseudocode:
It is Subjective not in Standard
Use white space and indentation effectively.
Capitalize key commands if necessary
write using simple terminology
Double check your pseudocode for readability and clarity.
Write only one statement in one line.

Demo Pseudocode:

IF A greater than B
     print  "A is Big".
ELSE
     print "B is Big".
