Pseudo code is a term often used in programming and algorithm.Different people use different programming languages, and that often becomes a problem.Developers who don't  know that language it would be hard to undestand it.To solve this problem we can use pseudocode.
"A special language that stands somewhere in between human language and code".
Pseudo code as the name suggests,is a false code  or a representation of codewhich can be understood by a persons who have basic knowledge on programming language.It mainly writes  the "logical core",which is essence of any program.
It will omit the the variable declarations,importing libraries etc..
	It is like blue print for the program.It better describes the idea of an algorithm without complications.It simply describes it in human language.
It improves the readability.
The main goal of a pseudo code is to explain what exactly each line of a program should do, hence making the code construction phase easier for the programmer.
Don't make pseudocode too generalized.
Don't make the code to abstract.

Tips for how to write a Pseudocode:
It is Subjective not in Standard
Use white space and indentation effectively.
Capitalize key commands if necessary
write using simple terminology
Double check your pseudocode for readability and clarity.
Write only one statement in one line.

Demo Pseudocode:

IF  (A>B)   THEN
     print  ("A is Big")
ELSE
     print ("B is Big")

Variables and Assigning
Syntax is pretty simple .The name of the variable is on left the value is on right,the assignment operator is in between.
a=23
b=32
c="Hello"

We can also assign the value of one variable to another Variable
x=1.5
y=x


Input and Output Data
We will typically avoid input and output.However if we need some external data,we will use this
a=input()
b=input()

s="Hello"
print(s)

Comments
a=7  //assigning 7 to variable a

Arithmetic Operations
a=7
b=2

sum=a+b        //Addition
dif=a-b	//Subtraction
 
prod=a*b	//Multiplication
quot=a/b     //Division  it gives  value 3.5
rem=a mod b      //It gives rem equal to 1
quot_int=a div b	//It gives Integer Division value equals to 3

Relational and Logical Operators
a==b
a!=b
a>=b
a<=b
a>b
a<b


Conditional Statements
a=10
b=20

if(a==10 and b==20) or not  (a==20 and b==10)  then:
	print (a)
	print (b)


a=-5
if a>0 then
	print ("Positive")
else:
           if (a==0)  then
	print ("Zero")
           else :
	print ("Negative")

Loops
Loops serve  to perform repeated Calculations.
We use two kinds of loops FOR,WHILE

i=0
while i<5:
	print (i)
	i=i+1

sum=0
for i in (1,9)
	sum=sum+i

print(sum)	

Arrays
Arrays are used to store  a collection of objects of the same type.
array[1,10]
fib=[0,1,1,2,3,5,8]  //Here it starts index from 1

x=fib[4]  //2
length=len(fib)

for i in  (1,len(fib)):
	print(fib[i])



array=[0,4,2,1,5]
subarray=array[2,4]
print (subarray) //4,2,1


Functions:
It is a piece of program code that can be accessed from another place in a program

function swap(a,b)
	temp=a
	a=b
	b=temp

c=3
d=5

swap(c,d)
print(c)
print(d)
